With the approval of the associate or the assistant dean for honors, students with a slightly lower average who have a reasonable expectation of meeting the requirement within one more semester may embark upon the honors thesis, understanding that if they do not attain the 3.3 standard they may continue the research project as independent study but are not eligible to graduate with honors or highest honors.","American Studies Major, B.A.–American Indian and Indigenous Studies Concentration",American Studies

Special Opportunities in Romance Studies,Honors,"The departmental honors program is open to any qualified major with a cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or higher and 3.5 or higher in their major courses. Eligible honors candidates will formulate a topic and select an appropriate faculty member to supervise the writing of an honors thesis. Specific coursework for the major with honors consists of enrollment in the honors thesis courses in the language of the major emphasis.691H is taken in the fall semester of the senior year and 692H is taken in the spring semester. FREN390, ITAL398, PORT398, SPAN397 and SPAN398 may be substituted for the 691H research course if the subject of the seminar is central to the research project chosen. In the 692H course, the thesis will be completed and the student will participate in an oral defense with the thesis director and two additional readers, to be agreed upon by the student and director. The thesis director, in consultation with the readers, will recommend that the student who has defended the thesis graduate with honors, highest honors, or with course credit. FREN390, FREN691H, ITAL398, ITAL 691H, PORT398, SPAN397 and SPAN398 may count toward the eight courses for the major, but FREN692H, ITAL692H, PORT692H, and SPAN692H may not. Students who intend to graduate in December should adjust the scheduling of these courses in order to allow for completion of the honors project in December.

Dual BachelorsMasters Degree Program,,"Students in the B.S. degree program with a GPA of 3.2 or better after five or more semesters of study have the option of applying to the dual B.S.M.S. program at UNCChapel Hill to pursue graduate coursework leading to the degree of master of science. Such students must complete the requirements for the bachelor of science degree within eight semesters. Upon completion of the B.S. degree, students then enroll as a graduate student to continue work towards the master of science degree.The requirements for the master of science degree can be found in the Graduate Catalog. Generally, the masters degree requires 30 additional hours of computer science coursework. Up to nine credit hours of computer science coursework taken while an undergraduate can be applied to the masters degree if the coursework is not also used to satisfy the graduation requirements for the bachelors degree. The requirements for the masters can be completed in as few as two additional semesters, for a total of 10 semesters of study.Students interested in the dual-degree program should have completed (or be on track to complete) seven computer science courses at the 400 level or higher by the end of their sixth semester. Students must formally apply for admission to the combined B.S.M.S. program, and it is expected that the application process would take place in the students sixth semester. Students applying in their sixth semester of study will be notified of the outcome of their application by the end of their sixth semester.Students interested in the dual-degree program are strongly advised to consult the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science in their sophomore year to discuss eligibility and an appropriate plan of study.","Computer Science Major, B.S.",Computer Science

Variable credit may be obtained for this course. ANTH393 is a controlled enrollment course; it requires the permission in advance of the faculty member sponsoring the internship, of a responsible official of the agency in which the internship is carried, and of the director of undergraduate studies. It is essential that students make arrangements and secure permissions prior to the semester of the internship.ANTH396 provides anthropology students the opportunity to engage in independent study, and ANTH395, the opportunity to engage in field research, in both cases under the mentoring of a specific faculty member. Variable credit may be obtained for these courses, although three units are usually expected. ANTH396 and ANTH395 require the permission of the faculty member under whom the student wishes to conduct research prior to the semester in which ANTH396 or ANTH395 is taken. Both are controlled enrollment courses. In general, these courses should be taken only by students with some prior coursework in anthropology or a related social science.ANTH451 and ANTH453 are six-unit field school courses in which the student gains hands-on experience in research and study in the field under the direction of a faculty member.Anthropology majors are limited to having no more than six credit hours of field-oriented coursework (ANTH393, ANTH395, ANTH451, or ANTH453) count toward meeting the major requirement, although they are not restricted from enrolling in more than six credit hours of these courses combined.","Anthropology Major, B.A.",Anthropology

Special Opportunities in Archaeology,Experiential Education,"The development of skills and perspectives beyond the classroom is considered central to the curriculum in archaeology. Hands-on training in field archeology provides students with the basic tools not only necessary for graduate training and advanced research in archaeology, but also for careers in cultural resource and heritage management through government agencies, contract firms, and museums. Developing an understanding of context and physical environment in archaeology requires field and laboratory experiences that are impossible to teach effectively in the classroom. Excavation and laboratory experiences allow students to participate directly in faculty research and to learn firsthand important aspects of the research process. Two or more field schools in archaeology are generally offered during summer sessions through the Study Abroad Office by faculty from the departments of anthropology, classics, religious studies, and history. In addition, many faculty research associates offer laboratory experiences through independent study projects and internships. These field work and laboratory experiences are designed to enhance the classroom training, allowing students to work as assistants to field archaeologists and specialistssuch as surveyors, archaeological architects, palaeoethnobotanists, zooarchaeologists, biological anthropologists, and geomorphologistslearning firsthand various aspects of data recovery, processing, and interpretation associated with archaeological field projects.","Archaeology Major, B.A.",Archaeology
